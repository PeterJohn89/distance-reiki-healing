            I was utterly blessed to have been the recipient of distance reiki from REIKI PRACTITIONER Uschi Herrmann
            I live in a remote part of Thailand so my health requirements are not always easily met and I‚Äôve needed to be creative about solutions. An associate of mine had recently had a distant reiki session with Uschi and was astounded by the results. Uschi is not only a reiki healer but she is a healer in many areas and fields of alternative health therapies. I found her genuine human kindness, her open joyful heart and approach to life refreshing and uplifting. Her Reiki practice is professional and Uschi conducts the session from an introduction through to an analysis and discission(more therapeutic counselling, considerations and insights).
            I have recommended her to everyone I know and they are receiving the gift of her healing and the good vibrations continue to snowball and hopefully little by little, one by one we CAN heal this world. Any skeptic or uncertain people  out there, just give it a go and see.

              There's no barriers for Reiki energy and no limits for this Reiki healer. Uschi is a dynamic and supportive person I greatly value.
              A distant Reiki session with her felt like uprooting weeds from the blossoming garden of my being. With ease, it brought up an old emotional pattern, restored and leveled up my energy.
              It's a gift of healing, and I recommend you to gift yourself.

              Something new I had too try
              I was aware of the healing art of Reiki and how it works channeling positive energy into your body, with masters and practitioners typically placing their hands on the affected areas of the body that need a boost, offering this energy and your body takes in the energy where most needed. What I had never tried was distance Reiki . Thanks to Uschi Herrmann I have now experienced this wonderful practice. I was given all the instruction I required and allowed myself to receive the Reiki , within a very short time of the practise starting I felt warm and relaxed in areas of my body which I know are problematic . It was a strange yet comforting warmth . Within a further short time I had relaxed so much that I was actually fast asleep .
              I felt myself stirring towards the end of the cycle and slowly woke , I could still feel the warmth in several areas of my body . It was a very rewarding session and I will definitely be continuing with this practice. This session occurred several days ago and after reflection I have noticed some more manageable movement in areas which were troublesome .
              I can not recommend Uschi enough for her treatment and her guidance. Thank you for this beautiful session

              I have received Reiki from Uschi when I was undergoing a tooth infection. During her session, I felt tingling and heavy a few times in my face where I had the pain.
              Also it was amazing to notice the electricity in other parts of my body and the sensation of numbness.
              That night the pain has significantly decreased helping me to have a much better night of sleep üíú

              I had a wonderful experience with Reiki distance healing with Uschi. I had experienced the amazing benefits of Reiki in 
              person before with Uschi but I was skeptical if distance Reiki would work in the same manner. I was amazed at the results!
              I went into the session with a very bad tension headache due to the stresses of work and Coronavirus in general and I had the
              most peaceful and healing experience. My headache was gone and I felt a sense of lightness and aliveness. I could feel the 
              healing energy flowing through me the whole session and for hours afterward. I highly recommend Uschi as a kind and compassionate
               healer and distance Reiki as being of very therapeutic value in these stressful and uncertain times. 
               I am very much looking forward to my next session and anticipate much more benefits for my health and anxiety now that my skepticism has been shattered. Thank you very much Uschi.

              I have had several distance reiki sessions with Uschi and each time I have had very much felt the reiki healing power 
              being channelled to me across thousands of miles back here in Brisvegas. Was having trouble with an enlarged liver and 
              after one session the pain and discomfort almost completely disappated. In my last session I definitely felt the same 
              healing power as if Uschi was present with me. I love the distance healing and being in my own comfort zone. It really works.
               I would highly recommend distance healing with Uschi who is also such a beautiful loving soul‚ù§Ô∏è

      <!-- 


      ‚ÄòI had a distance Reiki session with Uschi during this current Covid-19 crisis at a time when I was feeling the strain of social isolation, the stress of financial insecurity and the worry associated with having to make some major life changes. I seriously doubted that I would be able to relax sufficiently to receive the Reiki healing being offered.
      As it happened, I drifted into a deep state of relaxation during the session, listening to music that Uschi had prepared for me. Afterwards I felt a sense of peace and calm - the cloud of worry and anxiety had lifted. Since then I use the music whenever I feel stressed or anxious and it has the same calming effect on my nervous system. Uschi is a beautiful soul - warm and wise - open and real. I felt a connection with her immediately and trusted her to hold a space of healing for me.‚Äô

      Ich hatte gestern meine erste Distance-Reiki-Stunde bei Uschi, und bin begeistert. Erst hatte ich Zweifel ob das auf Distanz funktioniert, aber ich konnte die W√§rme sp√ºren und f√ºhlte mich nach der Stunde sehr ruhig und entspannt. Ich werde es den Patienten in meiner Naturheilpraxis weiterempfehlen.

      <!-- Each Energy Healer is unique in how they practise distance-healing sessions. Often making use all of the tools they have learnt whilst studying and practising healing. I use all the tools available to me including crystals and symbols. In my experience the most important thing is genuine total focus and intention.
            
      Reiki therapy is a natural method of energy balancing, to complement medical treatments.
